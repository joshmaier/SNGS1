Sow-n-Grow Version 1 - A density-based clustering algorithm using shared memory (implemented with OpenMP)

Dependencies:
1. g++

	g++ is required in order to compile the code

2. OpenMP
	
	OpenMP is required in order to do shared memory computing

How to run SnG:
1. Compile the source files using the following command

	make

2. Run using following command 

	./omp_dbscan -i filename -b -m minpts -n seeds -e epsilon -o output -t threads

	Example:

	./omp_dbscan -i clus50k.bin -b -m 5 -n 1000 -e 25 -t 8 -o test

	run the following to get detail description on the program arguments

	./omp_dbscan ?

3. Input file format:
	
	binary file:
	number of points, N and number of dimensions, D (each 4 bytes) followed by the points coordinates (N x D floating point numbers).

	text file:
	each line is a point (no need to mention the number of points or the number of dimensions).
